# @MarcDevGuy127's Portfolio Website

This project brings a new model for my oficial Portfolio website, within more simplified contents.


## Learnings

What I learned in this project?

> **Response:** _Belong this project I learned how to manage web elements with Bootstrap's framework. That website had introduced me for JavaScript animations and responsive concepts._

How this works?

> **Response:** _This website is provided by [Vercel's framework](https://vercel.com/), most used for deploying website, it offers statistics unlike visit's counting for analysis._

Inspirations?

> **Response:** _This project is based on my professor [Thiago Nascimento website](https://sites.google.com/site/nascimenthiago/home?authuser=0) and [C418 album's page](https://c418.org/albums/minecraft-volume-alpha/)._
